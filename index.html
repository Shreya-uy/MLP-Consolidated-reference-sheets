<h3> This page contains links to pages containing a summary of sklearn APIs covered in the lectures </h3>

<p class = "point"> 1. The sklearn APIs covered in the lectures are summarised under 4 categories </p>
<ol>- Data generation/preprocessing & model selection</ol>  
<ol>- models </ol>
<ol>- evaluation </ol>
<ol>- other related APIs - These are APIs needed to understand other/APIs or referred to infrequently in the lectures</ol>

<p class = "point"> 2. The dataset is provided to you as a link in the question. For loading the data onto google colab use either of the following: </p>

<p class = "sub-head"> Option 1: </p>
<p> Download the file and upload it to google colab (Using upload option under the folder icon in left panel). <br>
Please note this will have to be re-uploaded with every runtime restart. </p>
<p class = "sub-head"> Option 2: </p>
Download the file and save it onto your google drive. Run the below code to fetch the file from the drive: <br>
<p class = "code"> from google.colab import drive <br>
drive.mount('/content/drive') <br>
path ='/content/drive/MyDrive/"filepath"' (Replace filepath by the relevant location) <br> 
data = pd.read_csv(path) <br> </p>
  
<p class = "point"> 3. For sklearn API details, use ?help followed by the API name on google colab. </p>

<p class = "point"> 4. For common regression & classification API names replace the term regression/regressor by classification/classif (Indicated in the sheet). </p> 
<p> Tip: It is a good practice to submit your answers periodically on the portal to save progress. </p>
